To "push" changes to github repository:
    1. "git add ."      // adds files to be staged. "." does all filetypes. You can also type .py for all python files for examples
    2. git commit -m "say what changes you made and why"    // This collects all the staged files and adds developer notes
    3. git push         // actually pushes your staged changes to the repository
